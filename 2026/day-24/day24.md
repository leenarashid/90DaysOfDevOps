### Day 24 – Advanced Git: Merge, Rebase, Stash & Cherry Pick
----

#### Task 1: Git Merge — Hands-On
- [x] Create a new branch feature-login from main, add a couple of commits to it.
- [x] Switch back to main and merge feature-login into main
- [x] Observe the merge — did Git do a fast-forward merge or a merge commit?
- [x] Now create another branch feature-signup, add commits to it — but also add a commit to main before merging
- [x] Merge feature-signup into main — what happens this time?

- [x] What is a fast-forward merge?
 **Answer:**
A Git merge that moves the branch pointer forward without creating a new commit, used when the target branch has no new commits since the feature branch was created, resulting in a linear history.

- [x] When does Git create a merge commit instead?
 **Answer:**


Git creates a merge commit when the branches have diverged, meaning both the source and target branches have new commits that the other doesn’t have

- [x] What is a merge conflict? (try creating one intentionally by editing the same line in both branches)

 **Answer:**

 A situation in Git where changes in two branches overlap, and Git cannot automatically merge them, requiring manual resolution.

### Task 2: Git Rebase — Hands-On
- [x] Create a branch feature-dashboard from main, add 2-3 commits
- [x] While on main, add a new commit (so main moves ahead)
- [x] Switch to feature-dashboard and rebase it onto main
- [x] Observe your git log --oneline --graph --all — how does the history look compared to a merge?

- [x] What does rebase actually do to your commits?
**Answer:**

- When we rebase a branch onto another branch (say feature onto main), Git:

- Takes the commits in your branch that are not in the target branch (main)

- Reapplies them one by one on top of the target branch

- Creates new commits with new SHA-1 hashes (even if the content is identical)

- [x] How is the history different from a merge?
**Answer:**
**Merge:**

- Combines branches without changing existing commits

- Creates a merge commit

- History is non-linear (shows all branches)

**Rebase:**

- Rewrites your commits on top of another branch

- No merge commit

- History is linear (looks like a straight line)


- [x] Why should you never rebase commits that have been pushed and shared with others?
**Answer:**
You should never rebase commits that have been pushed and shared because rebase rewrites commit history, creating new commits. This breaks history for others who pulled the original branch, causing conflicts and confusion.


- [x] When would you use rebase vs merge?

**Answer:**

**Use merge when:**

- You want to preserve branch history

- Collaborating with others on a shared branch

- You don’t mind a non-linear (branchy) history

**Use rebase when:**

- You want a clean, linear history

- Working on local/private branches before merging

- You want to “replay” your commits on top of the latest main

### Task 3: Squash Commit vs Merge Commit
- [x] Create a branch feature-profile, add 4-5 small commits (typo fix, formatting, etc.)
- [x] Merge it into main using --squash — what happens?
- [x] Check git log — how many commits were added to main?
- [x] Now create another branch feature-settings, add a few commits
- [x] Merge it into main without --squash (regular merge) — compare the history

- [x] What does squash merging do?

Squash merging combines all commits from a branch into a single commit before merging, keeping the main branch clean and linear while preserving all changes.
- [x] When would you use squash merge vs regular merge?


**Use regular merge when:**

- You want to preserve full commit history of a branch

- Collaborating with others and tracking individual changes is important

- You don’t mind a branchy/non-linear history

**Use squash merge when:**

- You want a clean, linear main branch

- The branch has many small “WIP” commits you don’t need individually

- You just care about the final result, not intermediate steps




- [x] What is the trade-off of squashing?

 **Answer:**

#### Task 4: Git Stash — Hands-On

- [x] Start making changes to a file but do not commit
- [x] Now imagine you need to urgently switch to another branch — try switching. What happens?
- [x] Use git stash to save your work-in-progress
- [x] Switch to another branch, do some work, switch back
- [x] Apply your stashed changes using git stash pop
- [x]Try stashing multiple times and list all stashes
- [x] Try applying a specific stash from the list

<img src="images/fo-3.png" width="700">




- [x] What is the difference between git stash pop and git stash apply?

**git stash apply**

- Applies the stashed changes to your working directory but keeps the stash in the stash list.

- Useful if you want to reuse the same stash multiple times.

**git stash pop**

- Applies the stashed changes and removes the stash from the stash list.

- Convenient when you only need the stash once.


- [x] When would you use stash in a real-world workflow?
 **Answer:**

- You’re in the middle of work but need to switch branches quickly.

- You want to save unfinished changes without committing them.

- You need to pull, merge, or rebase without losing your current work

----
#### Task 5: Cherry Picking
- [x] Create a branch feature-hotfix, make 3 commits with different changes
- [x] Switch to main
- [x] Cherry-pick only the second commit from feature-hotfix onto main
- [x] Verify with git log that only that one commit was applied

<img src="images/5-2.png" width="700">

- [x] What does cherry-pick do?
 **Answer:**
Cherry-pick take a required commit and add it to your commit history. In ither words git cherry-pick takes a specific commit from one branch and applies it onto your current branch as a new commit.


- [x] When would you use cherry-pick in a real project?
 **Answer:**

You need a specific commit from another branch without merging the whole branch.

Hotfixes: apply a bug fix from develop to main.

Backporting: bring a feature or fix to an older release branch.

Selective changes: only take certain commits, not all branch history.



- [x] What can go wrong with cherry-picking?
 **Answer:**
- Can cause merge conflicts

- May create duplicate commits

- Can break code if the commit depends on others

- Rewrites history, which can confuse project history
